            <h1>What is Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <p>The concept of Neuroplasticity is fascinating. The concept that the act of thinking and doing are intrinsically linked hit me like a bomb. That merely thinking through a process as if you were actually doing it can develop the neural pathways in your brain, it will build and strengthen the bonds between neurons and increase the durability of those bonds.</p>

            <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because if you understand that with enough thought and practice any skill can be ingrained into your brain. That even if something is difficult, thinking about it, thinking about doing it, will develop that thing as a permanent skill in your mind.</p>
            <p>I will use the principles of neuroplasticity to reinforce my learning. I will use the ability of thought to reflect on things that I have learnt and things that I have done in order to reinforce the connections in my brain, to strengthen them and make it so that the skills I learn are not temporary skills or ideas that will be pruned from my mind and will need to be refreshed any time I require them, but that they will be strong and permanent concepts in my mind that I can call on at a moments notice.</p>
            
            <p>Some ways I can increase my neuroplasticity are by reflecting on things learnt, by thinking on the concepts and actions, and actively thinking about doing the actions, the processes required to perform them and how it works. Just thinking about these things will strengthen the bonds and pathways between neurons which when paired with performing the actions will permanently embed the actions in my mind.</p>

                <h2>What is Growth Mindset</h2>

                <p>The growth mindset is one that believes in the ability to improve. The basis of this mindset is that ones intelligence and knowledge is not a finite predetermined value. That knowledge can increase and the only limiting factor is the amount of effort one puts into learning.</p>

                <p>This is important as embracing this philosophy enables you to believe in yourself. That what you are capable of now is not all you can be capable of. That you can always improve, you can always develop. You can always increase your skills and knowledge. You can always grow.</p>

                <p>I had never heard of the growth mindset before I began this investigation, however none of this surprised me. As it is a mindset I already have developed. I was raised with a fixed mindset, however I reached a point in my life where I learnt that I was High Functioning Autistic and at that point I had to relearn everything I had learnt, and develop whole new methodologies on how to interact with the world. It was at this point I learned how to grow, and how with enough effort I could improve myself and my processes. And as such I have fully embraced this mindset without even knowing what it was.</p>
