            <h1>Sprint 2 - Learning Reflection</h1>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My long term goal / career pathway is to be a senior Web Developer. I have a lot of experience in the tech arena, and my web skills are a little rusty, okay a lot rusty, but hey it should be like riding a bike hey? Because at it's core being a Web developer is more around how you solve problems, and how you work alone and with others that qualifies you. Yes there is a requirement of technologies to understand, but that is all just learning. I love to learn and I look forward to always improving so I can get a job doing the thing I love, and can support and care for my family.</p>

                <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                <p>I would like to further develop my social skills, and how to work with other people. I have never worked in an Agile environment so would really like to learn what that is, as well as to gain an understanding of what it is like to collaborate with a dynamic team.</p>

           <h2>What are your own Strengths and Limitations?</h2>
           <p>This is a very large question. I have many strengths and many limitations. So many in fact I'm not sure that I can actually list them all. However I will do my best to get the main ones down.</p>
           <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
           <p>My biggest and most prevalent weakness is my Autism. Due to my autism, I encounter many difficulties, I struggle to follow conversations with more than one person speaking at a time, I struggle to understand meanings behind things that are said or written, I am completely oblivious to subtext and do not pick up on hints. I am extremely literal and can often take things completely out of context based off an accidental pause in a sentence. I struggle in social situations, especially with people I do not know, it is common for after a day in a room with strangers I will need to sleep for over 12-16 hours in order to recouperate. This is not ideal in the middle of a week, so I have managed to develop coping strategies which usually let me make it to the weekend.</p>
           <p>I am extremely quick to believe I understand what is being asked. Even if completely wrong. I often think I have it figured out only to discover I completely missed the point.</p>
           <p>I struggle with not having my ideas heard, it doesn't matter to me if whoever is listening thinks it is a great idea or if they think it is the worst idea in the world, I just like to feel heard.</p>
           <p>That being said, I can often struggle to voice my ideas in a coherant spiel on the fly. If on the spot or under pressure, I can get stuck in my throughts and end up repeating myself and looping through trying to figure out what I'm trying to say. (You can ask my wife about this one <i class="far fa-grin-wink"></i>)</p>
           <p>Ultimately most of my weaknesses stem from my Autism, and I am actively trying to improve myself constantly.</p>
           <h3>Strengths</h3>
           <p>One of my biggest strengths is also my Autism. Because of it, I have the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me. I am able to view problems from different angles, I am able to look at a problem and analyse it completely logically and can often find a solution.</p>
           <p>Other strengths I have are mostly developed in response to my autism, and they include but are not limited to: a drive to be better, to improve myself every day, the ability to admit when I don't know, or that I am wrong, a willingness to receive criticism to help me improve, the ability to ask for help when I need it, honesty in all areas, creativity borne of a slightly different perspective on the world, the ability to take in a lot of information, and many other.</p>
           <p>One strength I have which was the cause of it taking 23 years to be diagnosed is I have extreme empathy. When someone is upset or hurt I can usually tell pretty much straight away.This gives me a drive to help those in need, to assist when I can, and a compassion for people. Unfortunately it usually doesn't tell me WHY they are upset, and they need to tell me that bit.</p>

                <h2>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h2>
                <p>Managing the workload shouldn't be too much of an ask. Because of my drive and my desire to grow means I am champing at the bit to go. I want to learn and I want it all in my brain now. As such I think my issue will be restraint. This is backed by my hyper focus on things that I enjoy, with coding being one of those things. It is not uncommon for me to lose time in coding and to realise later I have been going for 8 hours straight. This is not a healthy practice, and I am working on it, but I do not see me sitting back until the last minute to get any work done.</p>
                <p>I will be jumping into the work the moment it is ready for me, and the moment I need help I will be sticking up my hand and asking.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How and where will you seek help?</h2>
            <p>I will seek help in all available avenues, I will use Slack to get help from my colleagues, I will ask questions of my facilitators, I will go to google when I need to and make use of the multitude of resources there. I will also contact the pastoral care /core team if there are any personal issues that I need help with.</p>

                <h2>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
                <p>I expect them to facilitate my learning. Whether this is to be there when I have questions, to guide me down the right path if I'm lost on a tangent, to help resolve any personality conflicts that may arise. As well as to instruct, inspire, and impart their knowledge and skills.</p>

            <h2>Are there any scheduling commitments you have existing?</h2>
            <p>I only have a weekend in taupo to early july, which shouldn't impact my course. Otherwise, I have 100% of my time available for this.</p>
