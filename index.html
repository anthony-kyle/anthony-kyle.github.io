		<h2 class="pt-5">What is PilcrowMicro?</h2>
		<p>
			PilcrowMicro is the embodiment of my style. It stems from the Pilcrow (¶), a symbol not so commonly used in todays world, but at the foundation of literary design from hand written ledgers, through the printing press, and thence to text editors in modern computing and printing. A symbol most have seen, most perhaps not knowing the history, or how this simple symbol has helped to shape the world we live in. Along with the Pilcrow comes Micro (µ). A more understood symbol denoting the small, the detailed, the underlying structure of life, leading towards where the future is leading us. Towards smaller and smaller technology and precision.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is when these two seemingly disparate symbols are united, we can see the underlying foundation for the world as we know it, the creative design, through structure and painstaking accuracy, to form something that is not appreciated because of who made it, but is appreciated for being what it is. This is what I strive to achieve with my work. Something that can exist on it’s own, and all who see it know it and enjoy it.
