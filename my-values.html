            <h1>What are my core personal values?</h1>
            <p>When first asked this question I honestly struggled. I have never sat down and quantified this before. I have certain rules I live by, and a desire to always improve myself, but could they be my values? I was unsure. First of all I had to identify what is a value. I went well down the rabbit hole on google, and found example lists of what values are, but I felt I couldn't really relate to majority of the items on those lists. Hitting a brick wall of uncertainty, I reached out for help, I asked my wife, my sisters, my friends, and my instructor at Dev Academy for help understanding what it was that I was searching to define. Through these conversations I was introduced to tools, and ideas, and responses that helped me understand what these "values" were all about.</p>

            <p>My eldest sister introduced me to a activity called Personal Values Card Sort<a class="reference" href="#ref1">1</a> which was a process of sorting a list of 50 personal values into three categories, Not Important To Me, Important to Me, and Very Important to Me. From this you can go through the list of Values and identify how you feel about each one. You can then from your resulting groups, narrow them down further until you reach your top three values. Going through this process greatly helped me understand what a value is and what values are important to me.</p>

            <h3>Value 1: Honesty</h3>
            <p>I value honesty above and beyond all things. I have High Functioning Autism / Asperger's, and as such I often misunderstand subtle nuances in conversations. Especially when people are hinting at things without actually stating them. For me to understand things I need 100% honesty, no holds barred, to the point many people would consider themselves rude. However it is with that direct honesty that I am able to understand. I also return that honesty. Because I abhor lying. I am always honest, to the point that rather than tell a white lie, I will ask if someone really wants me to answer because it will likely hurt. I strive to be Honest, to have integrity, and to be dependable and reliable.</p>

            <h3>Value 2: Growth</h3>
            <p>Since the moment I learnt of my autism, I discovered that my normal was not normal. That if I was to survive and flourish in life I would have to be better. I would have to learn how to adapt. I would have to learn how to grow and overcome challenges that are not necessarily normal. Things as simple as how to hold a simple conversation with more than one person, required me to completely understand the areas in which I struggled, and figure out how to be better. This started me on my journey of self discovery, and growth. And as I learn more about myself and where I struggle, I continuously try to improve myself. This desire for improvement has grown with me, and is no longer limited to making me be able to assimilate like a normal person, but rather to learn more about everything, to be interested in everything, to push myself in ways that are external as well as the internal. I want to be the best that I can be, in all areas of life. This doesn't mean I want to be better than anyone else, the only people I want to satisfy is myself and my wife.</p>

            <h3>Value 3: Love</h3>
            <p>My dream since I was younger was to find a Woman to love who loves me and to have a family. I have met and married my dream woman. And while we haven't started on the kids yet, they're not too far away. I spent my life searching for love, to find someone who would love me, who I could love with all of my being. The thing that I didn't count on when I found her was how much she would push me to pursue those things important to me. She loves seeing me happy, doing things that bring me enjoyment, and a sense of satisfaction. She loves to see me pushing myself to improve myself. Her love enables me to be better than I could ever be alone. In her response as to my values she states "Anthony is an ever evolving man. He always strives to be the best person he can be. His key values for me are honesty, hard working, loyal, and self improving."</p>

            <h2>What is an Ethical Decision I Have had to Make?</h2>

            <p>I had an extremely difficult decision I had to make extremely recently. For the past four and a half years I have worked at the family company. It is not a job I was passionate about, it was not a job I liked, in fact most of the time I strongly disliked the job. However I stayed there for four years because my parents required me to be there for the sake of the company, as I had become an integral part of the company. I put four and a half years of into a job that I hated because I love my parents, and they needed help. However a month ago, I discovered the Dev Academy course, and I knew it was time for me to begin to follow my own dreams. This was not taken well by my parents, who proceeded to make every day at the office a nightmare. I was the recipient of emotional and verbal abuse, with my father / boss screaming at me nearly every day, I would go home each day completely drained because of it. I wanted to stop going and I wanted to leave before my notice was up, however I made the decision to honour my commitment. I knew that my days would be hell, I knew that I would struggle, that I would be hurt, however I had an obligation to work. My personal ethics dictate that if I commit to something than I commit to it, there is no half assing it, there is no backing down, there is no changing your mind. No matter if it is difficult, painful, or worse than you could ever imagine. If I give my word, my word is given, and I must abide by my commitments, but not only do it, do it to the best of my ability. And so it was that I every day, turned up at work with a smile on my face, I worked my ass off every single day, and left in tears most days. Legally speaking I undoubtably would have had grounds to not show up, and file suit for any number of things, however ethically based on my moral code, it was more important that I do my part, that I live up to my promise, and that even in the face of hardship I stay true to my values of Honesty, Growth and Love.</p>

            <h2>How has my culture influence my values and identity?</h2>
            <p>My culture and how it has influenced my values and identity, requires being looked at through a slightly different perspective. It is not a racial culture that has influenced who I am, but rather the culture in which I was raised. I was raised in an environment of emotional manipulation, compartmentalisation, half truths, and isolation. I was raised in an environment where everything was the kids fault, not my parents, where guilt trips were common place, information was wilfully withheld to prevent us from understanding what was truly happening, and socialising with siblings was frowned upon because then we might talk and understand that something wasn't quite right. It is due in large part to these situations that I value honesty, love, and growth. Because if you are honest with each other and yourself, there is nowhere to hide any skeletons. If you accept your mistakes and strive to improve yourself you will not blame others for your failures rather you will be a better person. And if you truly love someone, you will support them no matter what they do, you will be there for them, encourage them, let them hate you if that is what they choose, because that is their right to do so, all the while you can love them and be there for them when they need you. My culture has shown me how not to be, and so it is that I strive to be better.</p>

            <h2>What are my Strengths and Weaknesses?</h2>

            <p>My weaknesses are many, I struggle to understand things in conversations with people, I struggle to follow multiple peoples conversations at the same time, I struggle to foresee consequences to actions, I struggle to read people, if I upset someone and don't understand what I did wrong I struggle to figure it out without being told what I did. Primarily my weaknesses are localised around social skills and emotional maturity.</p>
            
            <p>As plentiful and prevalent as my weaknesses are, my strengths are more numerous. What I see as my biggest strength, is my ability to accept that I'm wrong, my readiness to hear criticism and how I can improve, and subsequently my drive to improve based on that feedback. My wife Nicole stated "Anthony and my relationship has grown a lot since the moment I met him. He has this super power to improve.". This comes back to my key values of Honesty (identifying issues) and Growth (being better). Ultimately all of my strengths boil down to my key values. I am honest, loyal, dependable, hard working, accepting, forgiving, I value the input of others, and am ready to help out wherever I can. </p>

            <p>My "superpower to improve" will definitely help me with learning, as it is all part of how I learn about myself, how I learn about new things, and how I absorb all of that information. I will definitely encounter obstacles, such as this task, as when I started this I had no idea what it was all about or how to proceed. But I took my knowledge of my weakness in this area and talked with people who are strong in this area and they were able to help me understand and figure out what needed to be done.</p>

            <h2>What is an Instance Where Collaboration was impeded by Resistance or Tension?</h2>

            <p>There was a project I was in charge of at my previous job, where I was building a web interface / security shell around an AuthorIt HTML help system for distributing and managing our help files. And one day after overhearing a collaborative discussion between myself, the documentation writer and the head programmer, my boss/father decided he had questions on how we were doing it, and why we were doing it the way we were. There was instantly tension from the tone of his questions, taking the form of an interrogation questioning every aspect and every decision. Being the person in charge of the project I did my best to answer the questions as they were being asked, however the questions kept coming and I started to realise that I was missing some key piece of information around which was fundamental to be able to understand where my boss was going. Due to the nature of the "questioning", and my Autism, when I get flustered or am feeling attacked, I struggle to form complete sentences in my head with any form of speed, and so I was struggling to put together the statement that I could see that I was missing something that my boss was getting at and if he would explain that key piece of information I'm certain I could explain it to him. As I was struggling to put this sentence together in my head, and the questions were not stopping, I knew I needed a few moments of silence to be able to put together the thought cohesively, and as such I asked if we could take a moment so I could gather my thoughts. It was at this point that it stopped being a group discussion and a full attack on me and my "unwillingness to contribute" due to wanting to take a break, and it was at that point I was thrown out of the building for being "disrespectful".</p> 

            <p>This to me is an example of how there was a perfectly functional and viable project which is being developed by open and clear collaboration which was derailed by a single person. One who does not care about anyone's views apart from their own, and who is unable to accept that someone may know more about something in a field that they have zero experience in. From this experience (and countless others like it) I have learnt that there is no team with a person like that. In order to truly collaborate, ego must remain outside, that listening is just as important as contributing, and ultimately it is better to work with someone who will listen and understand and evaluate than someone who is a "genius". The key strategy that I would employ, is to choose my teams carefully, to understand what makes a good team, and to understand what is unacceptable behaviour, and not work with someone who flagrantly abuses everyone around them because they believe they are the best.</p>
