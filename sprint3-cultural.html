            <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h1>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence or EQ (Emotional Quotient) is the knowledge of ones self and others. It is about being aware of your actions and feelings, and the impact that your actions may have on others, and your ability to react appropriately.</p>        </div>

                <h2>What is IQ?</h2>

                <p>IQ or Intelligence Quotient is the measure of a persons reasoning ability. This gagues how well you are able to use information and logic to answer questions, make predictions, recognise patterns and the like. </p>

            <h2>What is the difference?</h2>
            <p>IQ and EQ are two sides of a coin, and everyone has a level of IQ and EQ, and the level of their IQ and EQ dictates many things about that person. I for example scored 142 on my IQ test when I did it as a teenager, however my EQ up until my early 20's was the equivalent of that of a 5 year old. This meant, I was, and still am, extremely logical, I excelled in structure and rule based situations such as mathematics, and music, however when it came to a being social and understanding how the world worked and how other people worked I was at a complete loss. I couldn't understand other people's feelings, I couldn't develop friendships, I couldn't work in a team, and I didn't understand myself. No matter how hight my IQ was I was unable to understand any of this.</p>
            <p>There is one common factor however between EQ and IQ which seems counter intuitive. Both your Intelligence Quotient and your Emotional Quotient are dynamic and can change. They are not set in stone. And being high in one does not preclude being high in the other. Of course there are things in this world that everyone can do better than other things, and in this realm often someone with high IQ struggles in the Emotional side of life. However intelligence can be improved upon. You can always learn more, and train your mind to understand highly complex ideas and situations. You can learn logic and reason, as such your IQ can be increased with effort. Similarly, if you struggle with social situations, you struggle with reading people, or the mood of the room. If you Struggle understanding your own motives or reasons behind thoughts and decisions. You can learn this too. You can learn how to identify your own feelings, identify what drives you, identify when others are upset and you can even use your logic to supplement this. The only requirement is that you put the time and effort into learning.</p>

                <h2>Why is EQ important</h2>

                <p>EQ is important because it gives you understanding. It helps you relate to others, and also helps them relate to you. If you have empathy for others, and are aware of them and their feelings, you show that you listen, you show that you care, people will notice.</p>
                
                <p>You could score off the charts with your IQ, and be technically proficient at anything you put your mind to, but if you don't have an emotional intelligence you can often seem arrogant, selfish, self-centered, callous, and many other things that drive people away. If you don't develop an emotional quotient, you will struggle to make friends, you will struggle to find a job in a team, you could of course find a job that suits solitude, where your emotional deficiencies are accepted. However in the current climate, people will choose a less technically capable person over someone more capable than them if their personality fits into the team better. Noone wants to work with an asshole.</p>

                <p>EQ is vital to understanding yourself, others and the world around you, and it truly is possible to learn. I know from experience. 10 years ago I was described by a professional to have the emotional maturity of a 5 year old, however today I sat a simple test at https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ei-quiz.htm, and I scored 40 out of a possible 75. This puts me at a position where I have an acceptable or "average" level of emotional intelligence. Which may not seem like much to strive to be average, but this proves that I have improved myself. I have drastically improved myself from a failing grade of someone who has essentially no EQ to being someone who is average. All I need to do now is keep striving to be better. Keep pushing to improve. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen if you try hard enough.</p>
